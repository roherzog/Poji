# Disclaimer and license

The codes, together with associated Excel-tables, test data and userguide (collectively named 'tools') can be used free of charge for research purposes. You must not distribute the tools without my consent. In addition, you undertake to include a citation of the paper in which these tools were published whenever you present or publish results that are based on them. I make no warranties of any kind on these tools and shall in no event be liable for damages of any kind in connection with the use of them. 

# Important information

The tools that are deposited here, relate to the publication:

"Poji: a Fiji-based tool for analysis of podosomes and associated proteins‚Äù by Herzog et al.; Journal of Cell Science, 2020, doi: (XXX) [source needed]."

The macro code and the associated Excel tables have been tested and verified with manually calculated results as much as possible to rule out potential errors. I am quite confident to state that all works as intended. Since hidden errors could still be present, I strongly advise every user to have a careful eye on their results as they are responsible for their own data. If you notice an apparent error or obtain results that do not match with a manual confirmation of the same sample, please feel free to contact me at r.herzog@uke.de.

# How to use the macro

To use the macro, download 'Poji.ijm' and install it in Fiji or ImageJ. You may optionally download and install the 'Split and Save Channels.ijm' file to correctly set up the files before using Poji. Also deposited are 3 premade Excel-tables for faster analysis of the output of Poji and two different images as test data for the use of Poji. For general use of macro, please refer the 'Userguide.pdf'.
