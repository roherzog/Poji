# Important information

The tools that are deposited here, relate to the publication:

"Poji: a Fiji-based tool for analysis of podosomes and associated proteins‚Äù by Herzog et al.; Journal of Cell Science, 2020, doi: 10.1242/jcs.238964"

The macro code and the associated Excel tables have been tested and verified with manually calculated results as much as possible to rule out potential errors. We are quite confident to state that all works as intended. Since hidden errors could still be present, we strongly advise every user to have a careful eye on their results as they are responsible for their own data. If you notice an apparent error or obtain results that do not match with a manual confirmation of the same sample, please feel free to contact the first author at r.herzog@uke.de.

# How to use the macro

To use the macro, download 'Poji.ijm' and install it in Fiji or ImageJ. You may optionally download and install the 'Split and Save Channels.ijm' file to correctly set up the files before using Poji. Also deposited are 3 premade Excel-tables for faster analysis of the output of Poji and two different images as test data for the use of Poji. For general use of macro, please refer to  'Userguide.pdf'. 

# Support

The macros and associated tables may be updated. The latest versions will always be placed directly into the respective repositories, while earlier versions will be moved to an "Outdated" folder. Updates are mainly for the inclusion of new functions, hence using an outdated macro version does not have an influence on the validity of data. In case an update has to be committed because an earlier version did produce wrong results, all affected versions will be labelled with "BUG!" immediately to warn users. The userguide will be updated to explain the new functions and a document which lists the version changes will be added. The version "v1,00" of codes describes the originally published version of the aforementioned publication.
