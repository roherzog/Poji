# Important information

The macro code and the associated Excel tables have been tested and verified with manually calculated results as much as possible to rule out potential errors. I am quite confident to state that all works as intended. Since hidden errors could still be present, I strongly advise every user to have a careful eye on their results as they are responsible for their own data. If you notice an apparent error or obtain results that do not match with a manual confirmation of the same sample, please feel free to contact me at r.herzog@uke.de.

If you publish data that were obtained by using this macro, please cite the original publication accordingly:

# How to use the macro

To use the macro, download 'Poji.ijm' and install it in Fiji or ImageJ. You may optionally download and install the 'Split and Save Channels.ijm' file to correctly set up the files before using Poji. Also deposited are 3 premade Excel-tables for faster analysis of Poji.output and two different images as test data for the use of Poji. For general use of macro, please read the 'Userguide.pdf'.
