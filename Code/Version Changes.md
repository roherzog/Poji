Version as presented in the associated publication.

v1,10:

Added: Option to additionally save profile results of all analysed images (sorted by channels) in a new folder called "Combined results".

Added: Preview window for setting of detection parameters now shows the number of detected podosomes.

Added: A warning is shown when the assigned results folder is not empty (danger of macro errors or overwriting of old results). User has to confirm to proceed. Declining will reset the macro (temporary folders are deleted) and the macro has to be restarted.

Changed: Results tables that included general information and single podosome intensities renamed from "Results (channel name)" to "Intensities (Channel name)". These results tables are now saved in the folder "Combined results".

Changed: Fixed file-separator replaced by automatic file-seperator to ensure compatibility with different OS.
